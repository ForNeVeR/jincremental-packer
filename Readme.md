jincremental-packer
===================
This is a script set to prepare incremental software updates using Jenkins.

Setup
-----
1. Prepare Jenkins job that will build your software and archive every build to a single artifact - a ZIP archive.
2. Create another job that will create incremental updates. This job must simply execute the following in the separate directory:

        ./Prepare-Release.ps1 http://server:8080/jenkins master_job_name

   Third optional parameter is the latest stable build number (for the cases when you want to diff not with previous version, but with some another).
3. Setup Jenkins to archive the `*.zip` artifact from the job output.

Package details
---------------
The artifact generated by the job will create a ZIP archive containing only the files changed between latest two versions.

There are also two special files: `Updates.txt` and `Deletes.txt`. These files will contain list of relative paths to the files updated (i.e. added or changed) in the latest package or deleted from it.

Ignored files
-------------
Packer will ignore any files in any directories named `App_Data`. Currently it's considered useful for deploying ASP.NET sites; feel free to provide feedback about that feature.
